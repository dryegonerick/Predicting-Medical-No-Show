    "\n",
    "# Data Collection and Preprocessing\n",
    "To train and evaluate our no-shows prediction model, we used a dataset from Project Pro containing over 110527 patients, and  14 columns medical appointments from our client a medical ERP solutions provider. The dataset includes features such as patient age, gender, appointment date and time, and the patient's medical history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training our model, we performed data preprocessing steps, including removing duplicates, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features. We also performed feature scaling to ensure that all features were on the same scale, which is essential for many machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Model Selection\n",
    "We evaluated three different machine learning models to determine the best-performing one for our no-shows prediction task. These models included Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. We used the Hyperopt library for hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the models' performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "After evaluating the models, we found that Gradient Boosting outperformed the other models in all the evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Therefore, we selected Gradient Boosting as our final model for no-shows prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Model Training and Evaluation\n",
    "We split our dataset into training and testing sets with a 70/30 ratio, respectively. We trained our Gradient Boosting model on the training set and evaluated its performance on the testing set. We also used cross-validation during the training process to ensure that the model was not overfitting the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluated our model using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also used confusion matrices and ROC curves to visualize the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model achieved an accuracy of 80%, precision of 70%, recall of 70%, and F1 score of 70%. The confusion matrix and ROC curve also confirmed the model's ability to accurately predict no-show appointments.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Model Interpretation\n",
    "Understanding how a model makes predictions is crucial for interpreting its results and taking necessary actions based on the predictions. For our Gradient Boosting model, we used feature importance analysis to determine which features were the most important in predicting no-shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found that the top three most important features were:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number of days between the appointment scheduling date and the appointment date\n",
    "* The patient's age\n",
    "* Whether the patient received a reminder message\n",
    "This analysis can help healthcare providers understand which factors contribute the most to no-show appointments and take necessary actions to prevent them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Model Drift\n",
